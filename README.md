# WineQualityPrediction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict wine quality using Apache Spark's MLlib. The model is trained in parallel on 4 AWS EC2 instances and deployed as a Docker container for efficient predictions. This document outlines the complete process to set up, train, validate, and deploy the application.
